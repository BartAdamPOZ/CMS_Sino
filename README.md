# CMS_Sino
Web application to manage relationships between agency and their clients.

Large Description: 

This project is built on technology: 
- PHP,
- HTML/CSS,
- JavaScript, jQuery,
- MySQL
Tested on a local Apache server. I also used XAMPP v3.3.0 application.

The purpose of the application is to create a space for managing the relationship between the agency and its clients. 

The application offers:
- adding a new agency employee
- adding a new client of the agency
- adding any number of people to be contacted by the client
- adding multiple companies to one agency employee
- displaying the collected data in the following configurations: 
    - client information + client package information + contact persons + supervisors 
    - information about clients of a particular supervisor
    - information about contact persons
    - information about available packages

All of that, and more, just only using Sino :)
